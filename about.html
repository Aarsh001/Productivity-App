              Planning and management are key aspects for any organization to function smoothly
and efficiently. Without a proper plan of action it becomes difficult to keep up with the deadlines.
This project aims to build an interface where anyone can easily plan their projects , set up
reminders and keep track of their progress.
The dashboard also has advanced features to create a forecast analysis depending on the
schedule of the user and suggest appropriate actions if he is lagging behind
With stunning visuals and a simple user interface we hope to make the tedious task of
organizing and management more enjoyable.
